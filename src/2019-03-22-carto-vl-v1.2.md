The last development cycle has been an intense one, and we're very happy to anounce that CARTO VL 1.2.3 is finally here.
Let's give an update on what we've been working on and what comes next.

## Cluster Labels

As Stephanie Mongon says in this [issue](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-vl/issues/1244), _"It's a common convention for cluster maps to be labeled with the number of features represented by the cluster marker"_. The first change we did was to properly expose the feature count per cluster in the API when using the `clusterCount()` expression.

Having the following variables declared in the viz string:

```
@ccount: clusterCount()
@features: viewportFeatures(@ccount)
```

You can access to each feature count through the feature `properties` and the **name** of the variable, in this case, `ccount`:

```
const features = viz.variables.features.value;
const firstFeatureCount = features[0].properties.ccount;
```

In order to explain how to use the labels to display information for each cluster, we've added two examples integrating Mapbox labels: [Label Cluster Counts](https://carto.com/developers/carto-vl/examples/#example-label-cluster-counts) and [Label Cluster Avg](https://carto.com/developers/carto-vl/examples/#example-label-cluster-average).

## Global Histogram is here

A new expression is here: [`GlobalHistogram`](https://carto.com/developers/carto-vl/reference/#cartoexpressionsglobalhistogram). We already had a `ViewportHistogram` expression in the previous versions of CARTO VL, but this new expression was needed to keep consistency with the rest of the viewport and global expressions. In addition, we've included a [new guide](https://carto.com/developers/carto-vl/guides/build-custom-charts/) where you can learn how to draw charts by using both viewport and global histogram expressions.

In this guide we tell how to use these expressions to draw custom charts. However, we'll have Airship histograms fully integrated with CARTO VL through **Airship Bridges** soon, a new incredible feature implemented by Román.

## More and better examples to the rescue

We're aware of the importance of having great, clean and well organized code examples. They're very useful to have an instant understanding of what CARTO VL is capable of, but they're also a good learning resource. Therefore, we've taken our time in improving the examples section.

This is what we did so far:

1. Review, clean and reorganize examples. We checked the examples one by one, refactored them, and improved how we exposed them in the [examples page](https://carto.com/developers/carto-vl/examples/)
2. New "Animation" section. Mamata has been working hard on this section, which includes **seven** examples to provide a better understanding of how animation works in CARTO VL.
3. New [Interactive Filter](https://carto.com/developers/carto-vl/examples/maps/interactivity/interactive-filter.html) example.
4. New [Interactive Classification](https://carto.com/developers/carto-vl/examples/maps/advanced/classification-variables.html) with variables example.

All the changes and improvements are also documented in our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-vl/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
