# **CARTO VL**

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/CartoDB/carto-vl.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/CartoDB/carto-vl)

**CARTO VL** is an open source JavaScript library for developers to create vector-based visualizations inside Location Intelligence applications.
The library is currently in its Beta version and we welcome [your feedback](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-vl/issues) and requests to make it even better!

## Features

- Maps are rendered client-side, instead of being rendered on the server. As a result, we provide faster load times and overall app performance by eliminating potential server problems.
- Built-in smart point aggregations and geometry simplifications making it easier than ever to visualize and interact with larger datasets. CARTO VL does this in a dynamic and automatic way, meaning you don’t need to rerun costly and time-expensive pre-processing steps over the geometry.
- Ability to modify geometries directly in the browser. This is a powerful solution for animated visualizations of points, lines, and polygons.
- Full control over everything happening on the map and can provide rich reactions to user interactions.
- New and intuitive map styling language that is designed specifically for multi-scale, thematic cartography. With just a few lines, complex visualizations can be created. Non-programmers can create their first map easily, while programmers will still be able to exploit the full potential of the CARTO ecosystem.

## Example

Run this

```
width: 8
color: ramp(buckets($dn, [80, 100, 140]), prism)
strokeWidth: 0
filter: $dn > 60
```

## I want to make a map

To start, you will need a basic HTML file structure to display your map in a browser. We recommend you to follow this [Getting started](https://carto.com/developers/carto-vl/guides/getting-started/) guide to create a basic map.

Then, start by getting familiarized with [CARTO VL's Syntax](https://carto.com/developers/carto-vl/guides/the-basics-of-syntax/) and follow up with all our available introduction guides:

- [Expressions](https://carto.com/developers/carto-vl/guides/introduction-to-expressions/)
- [Interpolation](https://carto.com/developers/carto-vl/guides/introduction-to-interpolation/)
- [Styling](https://carto.com/developers/carto-vl/guides/introduction-to-styling/)
- [Animation](https://carto.com/developers/carto-vl/guides/introduction-to-animation/)
- [Interactivity](https://carto.com/developers/carto-vl/guides/introduction-to-interactivity/)

Also, take a look at our [examples](https://carto.com/developers/carto-vl/examples/) to understand the possibilities and inspire you!

An alternative way is to use our [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@carto/carto-vl). Take a look at an example [here](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-vl-webpack-demo
).

```
npm i @carto/carto-vl
```

Happy mapping!

That's great! We are more than happy to receive your contributions to the code and its documentation.

### Install

To clone and run this library, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-vl

# Go into the repository
$ cd carto-vl

# Install dependencies (node >=6.11.5 is required)
$ yarn

# Bundle the library
$ yarn build
```

For more information, please read [DEVELOPERS.md](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-vl/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md).

### Start developing

Get started using CARTO VL's documentation at [CARTO's Developer Center](https://carto.com/developers/carto-vl/).

 - [Guides](https://carto.com/developers/carto-vl/guides/): get to know the library!
 - [Full reference API](https://carto.com/developers/carto-vl/reference/): for specific methods, arguments, and sample code.

### Play with the examples

You can find all the [examples](https://carto.com/developers/carto-vl/examples/) on the documentation in the `examples` folder. There are also some developer focused examples on the `debug` folder.

Run the following commands to access them locally:

```bash
# Bundle the library with a watch dog
$ yarn build:watch

# Run a server
$ yarn serve
```

Lastly, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-vl/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information about submitting pull requests to us. You will need to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before making a submission. [Learn more here.](https://carto.com/contributions/)

## Feedback

CARTO VL is still in Beta but we encourage you to start playing with it and to please [send us feedback](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-vl/issues) so we can create an even better library, suited to your needs.

## Works with

CARTO VL is a geo-spatial data visualization library. However it doesn't include basemap rendering capabilities. Therefore, CARTO VL needs to be used with [Mapbox GL](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js) as a basemap provider. You'll need to use Mapbox GL for controlling the center and zoom level of your map too. The integration is seamless, but you will need to use one of our patched versions as shown in the examples.

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-vl/tags).
