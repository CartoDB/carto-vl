## Animated visualizations
With CARTO VL you can make animated maps of points, lines and polygons using the [`animation`](/developers/carto-vl/reference/#cartoexpressionsanimation) expression. In this guide, you will learn how to make animated maps that tell a story by gaining a better understanding of how to adjust animation parameters based on the type of data you are mapping.

<div class="example-map">
    <iframe
        id="animation-step-7"
        src="/developers/carto-vl/examples/maps/guides/animation/step-7.html"
        width="100%"
        height="500"
        frameBorder="0">
    </iframe>
</div>


### Create a basic animation
Before we begin with the details, it is important to understand the general syntax for animating data in CARTO VL:

```CARTO_VL_Viz
filter: animation(input, duration, fade(fadeIn, fadeOut))
```

We will walk through each part throughout this guide.

Using the syntax above, let’s create a basic animation where points appear and disappear on a map. We will use a `date_time` attribute (a time associated with each feature) as our `input`, set the `duration` to `10` seconds and set both `fade` parameters to `1` second.

The result is an animation that cycles through all of the records in the dataset over 10 seconds. Each point will take 1 second to become visible (_fade in_) and another second to disappear (_fade out_). You can see it in action in the next map.

```js
const viz = new carto.Viz(`
    filter: animation($date_time, 10, fade(1, 1))
`);
```

<div class="example-map">
    <iframe
        id="animation-step-0"
        src="/developers/carto-vl/examples/maps/guides/animation/step-0.html"
        width="100%"
        height="500"
        frameBorder="0">
    </iframe>
</div>

**Note:**
If you're wondering about the points, this is an animation of the journey of three birds, from January to April of 2014. It is using data from [movebank.org](https://www.movebank.org/) and the *date_time* column represents the date of the bird track and its associated timestamp. You can check the code of the previous map to see how to configure this *bird_journey* as the `carto.source.Dataset` for the visualization.


#### The filter property
Now that we have a basic map of animated points, let’s get a deeper understanding of the different pieces that make up the animation expression to fine-tune the visualization.

In the example above, the animation expression is set to the `filter` property (for more information see the [vizSpec](/developers/carto-vl/reference/#vizspec)).

The convention in CARTO VL is that:
* `0` represents the boolean value `false` (the *absence of* or an *off* state) and
* `1` represents `true` (the *presence of* or an *on* state).

In the context of an animation expression assigned to a `filter`, any feature that has a value of `0` will be “filtered-out” and not shown, while any feature that meets the filter is assigned a value of `1` and is shown.

You can think of the animation expression like a clock, cycling through each record of the input. Any time there is a match, the feature is drawn.

Now that we’ve gone through a more in-depth discussion of how features are drawn, let’s take a look at the next set of animation parameters, and how they are used to define the property, speed, and transition between animated features.


#### Input
The first animation parameter (`input`), is the attribute that you want to animate. By default, the animation progresses from the attribute minimum to maximum values.


#### Duration
This parameter defines the duration of the animation in seconds. As stated above, during the animation cycle, all possible input values are evaluated. When an input value is matched, animation returns a value of `1` for the feature and it is drawn.


#### Fade
The `fade` parameter is used to define two additional (`fadeIn, fadeOut`) durations in seconds. These parameters allow for smooth transitions between features during the animation. During the *`fadeIn`* phase, all features with a match will fade-in to the animation, transitioning from `0` (invisible) to `1` (visible). During the *`fadeOut`* phase features will transition from `1` back to `0` and the next set of features will begin to fade-in.


### Style and configure the animation
To illustrate these concepts, we'll keep on working on the animated journey of our three birds.

#### Animate points
At the beginning of the guide, we created a simple point animation using the attribute `$date_time` for the temporal input, set the duration to `10` seconds and both fade parameters to `1` second:

```js
const viz = new carto.Viz(`
    filter: animation($date_time, 10, fade(1, 1))
`);
```

<div class="example-map">
    <iframe
        id="animation-step-1"
        src="/developers/carto-vl/examples/maps/guides/animation/step-1.html"
        width="100%"
        height="500"
        frameBorder="0">
    </iframe>
</div>


#### Adjust the duration
In the animation above, we can see that the birds spend the majority of this three month period in West Africa and then eventually migrate to Northern Europe. To see the journey in more detail, we'll adjust the duration to `30` seconds. Now looking at the map, we can see that each bird, at a different time, flies north along the coast of Morocco to Eastern Europe.

```js
const viz = new carto.Viz(`
    filter: animation($date_time, 30, fade(1, 1))
`);
```

<div class="example-map">
    <iframe
        id="animation-step-2"
        src="/developers/carto-vl/examples/maps/guides/animation/step-2.html"
        width="100%"
        height="500"
        frameBorder="0">
    </iframe>
</div>


#### Adjust fade
Since we are visualizing bird migration, we want to show more clearly, through symbology, the journey the birds took. We can get this added effect by adjusting the `fade` parameters. By setting `fadeIn` to `0` and `fadeOut` to `0.5`, we keep the previous point in the animation visible for longer which helps us better visualize the flight path of the migration journey.

```CARTO_VL_Viz
filter: animation($date_time, 30, fade(0, 0.5))
```

<div class="example-map">
    <iframe
        id="animation-step-3"
        src="/developers/carto-vl/examples/maps/guides/animation/step-3.html"
        width="100%"
        height="500"
        frameBorder="0">
    </iframe>
</div>


#### Final touches
Since this visualization represents the journey of three different birds, we can assign a unique color to each one, using their names to define `buckets` inside of a `ramp`. We will also decrease the `width` of the points to `4` and finally, remove the `strokeWidth` by setting it to `0`.

**Note:**
For a more in-depth discussion of ramps and other styling properties, check out our [Data-driven visualizations guide - part 1](/developers/carto-vl/guides/data-driven-visualizations-part-1/).

```js
const viz = new carto.Viz(`
    filter: animation($date_time, 10, fade(0, 0.5))
    color: ramp(buckets($bird_name, ["Sanne", "Eric", "Nico"]), [deeppink, yellow, turquoise])
    width: 4
    strokeWidth: 0
`);
```

<div class="example-map">
    <iframe
        id="animation-step-4"
        src="/developers/carto-vl/examples/maps/guides/animation/step-4.html"
        width="100%"
        height="500"
        frameBorder="0">
    </iframe>
</div>


### Animation controls
Congratulations! You have created an animated visualization.

Next, let’s add some animation controls to play and pause the animation as well as a slider to adjust the duration of the animation on-the-fly.


#### Add variables
To get started, we need to add two variables inside of our Viz object: `@duration` and `@animation`. Making the duration of the animation a variable (`@duration`) and putting that inside of the animation expression will allow us to dynamically modify the duration of the animation using the controls on the map.
```js
const viz = new carto.Viz(`
    @duration: 30
    @animation: animation($date_time, @duration, fade(0, 0.5))
    filter: @animation
`);
```

The variables are now available in the `viz` object that we created in the previous step. If you want to access the animation variable you can do it by typing `viz.variables.animation`. By assigning the animation expression to the `@animation` variable, you are going to be able to call its [public methods](/developers/carto-vl/reference/#expressionsanimation) as follows:

```js
viz.variables.animation.play();
```


#### Add animation controls
The next step is to add buttons and elements that allow you to control and interact with the animation.

The elements we will add are:
* **Progress**: a slider that shows the time progression of the animation (`js-progress-range`).
* **Play**: a button to play or resume the animation (`js-play-button`).
* **Pause**: a button to pause the animation (`js-pause-button`).
* **Duration**: a slider to control the length of the animation (`js-duration-range`).
* **Current**: a text to display the current timestep of the animation (`js-current-time`).

To display the controls, you're going to create a panel. You have to add this just under the map, like this:
```html
<div id="map"></div>
<!-- Animation control elements -->
<aside>
    <header>
        <h1>Animation controls</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <p>Progress: <input type="range" id="js-progress-range" min="0" max="1" step="0.01"></p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Current: <span id="js-current-time" class="open-sans"></span></p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <button id="js-play-button">Play</button>
        <button id="js-pause-button">Pause</button>
        <input type="range" id="js-duration-range" min="1" max="30" step="1">
    </section>
</aside>
```

As seen above, there is an `id` attribute assigned to each element which we can use to access them using JavaScript:

```js
const $progressRange = document.getElementById('js-progress-range');
const $playButton = document.getElementById('js-play-btn');
const $pauseButton = document.getElementById('js-pause-btn');
const $durationRange = document.getElementById('js-duration-range');
const $currentTime = document.getElementById('js-current-time');
```

**Note:**
This guide makes use of some conventions. When setting an `id` to an element that is going to be accessed via JavaScript, the `id` starts with `js`. In addition, when assigning the element (`const $progressBanner = document.getElementById('js-progress-banner')`), the JavaScript value starts with `$`, which indicates that it contains an HTML element.


#### Add listening events
In this step, we will add listening events tied to the different interaction buttons used to control the animation as described above. For example, we will tell the **Pause** button that it has to be ready and react when clicked to pause the animation.

```js
$pauseButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    viz.variables.animation.pause();
});
```

And the same applies to the **Play** button:

```js
$playButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    viz.variables.animation.play();
});
```

In the same way, we can update the **duration** of the animation when the duration range is adjusted in the slider:

```js
$durationRange.addEventListener('change', () => {
    viz.variables.duration = parseInt($durationRange.value, 10);
});
```


#### Update the progress bar
Now that we have added the listening events for the different buttons and defined the behavior upon interaction, next we will walk through updating the progress bar and the current time text.

The `updateProgress` function will be responsible for:
- updating the progress bar through the duration of the animation, using the range value provided by the `getProgressPct()` method and
- displaying the current time, by updating a span with the current `getProgressValue()` method:

```js
function updateProgress () {
    $progressRange.value = viz.variables.animation.getProgressPct();
    $currentTime.innerText = viz.variables.animation.getProgressValue();
}
```

Let’s call this function periodically by using `setInterval`:

```js
setInterval(updateProgress, 100);
```

**Note:**
The `setInterval()` is a commond method available at the browser, that calls a function or evaluates an expression at specified intervals, in milliseconds. You can also do this update by listening to `carto.layer` events. This topic is covered more in-depth in the [Interactivity and Events Guide](/developers/carto-vl/guides/interactivity-events/); once you know how, the second options is preferred.


#### All together
Well done! In the example below you will find the full code, including the animation controls. You can play with it and make adjustments.

Remember you can style your HTML controls using CSS. These styles are very simple, but at the beginning of this guide you have a complete example that includes beautiful styles. This example is also available in the [examples section](/developers/carto-vl/examples/#example-animation-controls).

<div class="example-map">
    <iframe
        id="animation-step-5"
        src="/developers/carto-vl/examples/maps/guides/animation/step-5.html"
        width="100%"
        height="500"
        frameBorder="0">
    </iframe>
</div>

```js
const map = new mapboxgl.Map({
    container: 'map',
    style: carto.basemaps.darkmatter,
    center: [-0.12796893854942937, 35.1654623242204],
    zoom: 2.8,
    scrollZoom: false
});

const nav = new mapboxgl.NavigationControl();
map.addControl(nav, 'top-left');

// Autenticate the client
carto.setDefaultAuth({
    username: 'cartovl',
    apiKey: 'default_public'
});

// Create the source
const source = new carto.source.Dataset('bird_journey');

// Add better styles
const viz = new carto.Viz(`
    @duration: 30
    @animation: animation($date_time, @duration, fade(0, 0.5))
    filter: @animation
    width: 4
    strokeWidth: 0
    color: #1785FB
`);

// Create the layer
const layer = new carto.Layer('layer', source, viz);

// Get animation control elements
const $progressRange = document.getElementById('js-progress-range');
const $playButton = document.getElementById('js-play-button');
const $pauseButton = document.getElementById('js-pause-button');
const $durationRange = document.getElementById('js-duration-range');
const $currentTime = document.getElementById('js-current-time');

// Listen to interaction events
$playButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    viz.variables.animation.play();
});

$pauseButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    viz.variables.animation.pause();
});

$durationRange.addEventListener('change', () => {
    viz.variables.duration = parseInt($durationRange.value, 10);
});

// Update progress each 100 milliseconds
function updateProgress () {
    $progressRange.value = viz.variables.animation.getProgressPct();
    $currentTime.innerText = viz.variables.animation.getProgressValue();
}

setInterval(updateProgress, 100);

// Add the layer to the map
layer.addTo(map);
```

### Taking it further
In this section, we explore other properties that can be used for your animation, including how to animate only a subset of the data and how to symbolize that time range with color.

In the examples above, we are animating the entire timespan of the bird journeys using `$date_time` as our input. If we want to only visualize a subset of the timespan, we can change the input range of values using a `linear` expression combined with a [`time`](/developers/carto-vl/reference/#cartoexpressionstime) expression:

```js
const viz = new carto.Viz(`
    filter: animation(linear($date_time, time('2018-01-01T00:00:00'), time('2018-01-05T00:00:00'))
`);
```

**Note:**
Values outside of the specified range will not appear in the animation.

This isn’t only limited to timestamp properties. If your input property is a number, for example the month of the year ranging from `1-12`, you can adjust the input parameter to that attribute (`$month`) and define the min and max range (`2,6`) that you want to visualize:

```js
const viz = new carto.Viz(`
    filter: animation(linear($month, 2, 6))
`);
```

You can also apply the same time range (`@timeSteps`) to other properties like color using a `ramp` expression. That double-encoding of the same time dimension, within the filter and the color, will reinforce the expressiveness of the visualization:

```js
const viz = new carto.Viz(`
    @duration: 10
    @animation: animation(@timeSteps, @duration, fade(0, 0.5))
    @timeSteps: linear($date_time, time('2014-03-30T20:24:25Z'), time('2014-04-24T23:52:14Z'))
    color: ramp(@timeSteps, SunsetDark)
    filter: @animation
    width: 10
    strokeWidth: 0
`);
```

As you can see in the result, we are able to visualize, via color, where each bird is at the same time range in the data and get some interesting insights about their journeys.
