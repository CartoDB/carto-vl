## Glossary

### Implicit cast

A *implicit cast* is a transformation done automatically (implicitly) by one CARTO VL expression to another one. Its purpose is to provide *syntax sugar* over another expression which is equivalent but more verbose and difficult.

For example, when using `ramp($numericProperty, [red, blue])` the `ramp` expression will implicitly cast `$numericProperty` to `linear($numericProperty)`, and the `linear` expression will implicitly cast that to `linear($numericProperty, globalMin($numericProperty), globalMax($numericProperty))`, which is a much larger and more verbose form, but it is semantically the same.


### Others bucket

The *others bucket* is a category that is generated by some CARTO VL functions like `buckets` and `top`. This bucket will contain all the categories that were grouped together in the last place.

There is more information in the [Data driven visualization guide]()


### Variables

*Variables* are a way to store and reuse expressions. We use the `@` notation followed by the name to declare and use the variable in the *String API*. The expression `s.var('name')` can also be used to refer to variables in the *JavaScript API*, that should be declared inside the `variables` scope. For example:

**String API**
```js
const viz = new carto.Viz(`
  @size: 10
  width: @size
`);
```

**Javascript API**
```js
const s = carto.expressions;
const viz = new carto.Viz({
  variables: {
    size: 10
  },
  width: s.var('size')
});
```

Variables can be accessed directly from the `carto.Viz` object. If variables do not contain dynamic (animation) or data-driven (properties) information can be also evaluated there:
```js
viz.variables.size.eval();  // 10
```

If the variables contain Properties (*Data-driven variables*), they can be evaluated from the feature object in the interactivity event callbacks (see [carto.Interactivity](/developers/carto-vl/reference/#cartointeractivity)).
