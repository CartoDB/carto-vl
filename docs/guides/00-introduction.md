## Introduction

Welcome to the CARTO VL guides!

This documentation is meant to lead you from the basics of creating a map to advanced techniques for developing powerful interactive visualizations.

CARTO VL relies on [Mapbox GL](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api) to render basemaps. Mapbox GL can be used for other functionality too, read [Mapbox GL documentation](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) for more information. However, keep in mind that CARTO VL layers can only be controlled with the [CARTO VL API](/developers/carto-vl/reference/) and that Mapbox GL native layers can **only** be controlled with the Mapbox GL API. Therefore, CARTO VL expressions cannot be used for Mapbox GL layers and vice versa.

Here you will find a series of guides that are meant to lead you from the basics of creating a map to more advanced techniques for developing powerful, interactive visualizations with CARTO VL.

Below are short descriptions for each guide to help you get started:

* **Getting started**: the basics of getting started with CARTO VL from setting up your `.html` file to adding data and visualizing it.
* **Add data sources**: gain a better understanding of what data sources CARTO VL supports, how to add them to your map, and when to choose one source type or another.
* **Style with expressions**: learn about the foundational pieces of styling properties in CARTO VL, the use of expressions and the visualization API.
* **Data-driven visualizations (part 1)**: get introduced to the `ramp` expression and explore its use to match inputs to values over a variety of data properties.
* **Data-driven visualizations (part 2)**: build upon the use of `ramp` and explore its use for a wider variety of map types.
* **Aggregation and data summaries**: explore the use of aggregation functions to extract and visualize a variety of values from your datasets.
* **Zoom-based styles**: learn how to take advantage of features for zoom-based styling for multi-scale thematic mapping.
* **Animated visualizations**: learn how to make animated maps that tell a story by gaining a better understanding of animation parameters.
* **Add interactivity and events**: learn how to add user interactions to make your visualization more dynamic and provide a richer experience for the end-user.
* **Add legends**: explore how to enrich your visualizations with legends to aid interpretation of symbolized features.
* **Add widgets**: explore how to enrich your visualizations with widgets to provide additional context from your datasets.
