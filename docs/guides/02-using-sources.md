## Using data in your visualization with Sources
In this guide you will learn how to use different data sources for your CARTO VL visualizations. After practicing with it, you will be able to connect to your datasets in several ways, and you will know which is the better option for you.

This guide assumes that you have previously gone through the [Getting Started Guide](/developers/carto-vl/guides/getting-started), so you already know how to make a simple map.


### How to get data
CARTO VL is a library that visualizes geographical datasets in a powerful and flexible way. Those datasets can be yours or they can be served by some other provider, but the first step to know is where they are hosted and how they can be accessed.

Our library currently supports these three options:
* **Dataset**: a vector dataset hosted by CARTO and available with your credentials (for example, a dataset with all the *stores in your city*).
* **GeoJSON**: a vector dataset in GeoJSON format.
* **SQL**: a Dataset with a SQL query applied to it (e.g. just the *stores with > 500 sq meters*).

Every option is a different kind of **Source**, and CARTO VL provides you with a suitable object in its API to connect to them under the namespace `carto.source` (for example `carto.source.Dataset`).

Both *Dataset* and *SQL* are based in [Vector Tiles](https://carto.com/help/glossary/#vector-tile), following *Mapbox Vector Tile Specification* or [MVT](https://www.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/specification/). This is an advanced technology which allows transferring geographic data from the server to your browser in small chunks, allowing a good performance and powerful dynamic styling.
> In fact, there is a fourth type of source in CARTO VL called [MVT](/developers/carto-vl/reference/#cartosourcemvt) but it is not meant to be used directly by the users, except in very precise / advance cases.


Now you will see how to use the main three type of sources, but first let's create a basic map.

You can start from this [basemap](/developers/carto-vl/examples/getting-started/basemap). Go ahead and clone its source code into a new file called `sources.html`, we will wait for you...


### Dataset
A `Dataset` can be managed using [carto.source.Dataset](/developers/carto-vl/reference/#cartosourcedataset). It is a source with information regarding to an specific topic (such as *stores*, *streets* or *counties*). If you have a GIS background, this is like a vector file with points, lines or polygons, but hosted at CARTO. If you don't, you can imagine it as a simple table at the server, with a geometry field you can map.

#### Add a Dataset
You already know how to add a `Dataset` thanks to *Getting Started* guide:
```js
const aSource = new carto.source.Dataset('name_of_your_dataset');
```
That was using `carto.setDefaultAuth` method, but now you will see how to include custom credentials for an specific dataset. Add this to your current working file (*sources.html* if you followed our suggestion), just after map creation.
```js
const citiesSource = new carto.source.Dataset('populated_places', {
    user: 'cartovl',
    apiKey: 'default_public'
});
```

As with any `Source`, you should then pass it to a `Layer` to visualize it, but first let's create its Viz with a style:
```js
const citiesViz = new carto.Viz(`
    color: grey
    width: 4
`);
```

Now you're ready for the layer creation
```js
const citiesLayer = new carto.Layer('cities', citiesSource, citiesViz);
```

And now you can add that layer to the map, so include this code:
```js
citiesLayer.addTo(map);
```

The result should look like this:
<div class="example-map">
    <iframe
        id="guides-sources-step-1"
        src="/developers/carto-vl/examples/maps/guides/sources/step-1.html"
        width="100%"
        height="500"
        frameBorder="0">
    </iframe>
</div>

#### When to use a Dataset?
You have a CARTO account, with several custom datasets, and you want to easily visualize one of them in a map, with all its rows.


### GeoJSON
A `GeoJSON` can be used in CARTO VL with [carto.source.GeoJSON](/developers/carto-vl/reference/#cartosourcegeojson). GeoJSON is an standard format to encode geographic data using JavaScript. It is indeed a common JSON, extended with spatial features, and you can easily create some *.geojson* contents online at [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/).

With the next steps, you'll create a new layer with this format, in this case visualizing the main *CARTO offices*.

First you can include GeoJSON content and embed it directly in your JavaScript, like this:
```js
const offices = {
    "type": "FeatureCollection",
    "features": [
        {
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": {
                "type": "Point",
                "coordinates": [-73.944158, 40.678178]
            },
            "properties": {
                "address": "Brooklyn, New York"
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": {
                "type": "Point",
                "coordinates": [-3.70379, 40.416775]
            },
            "properties": {
                "address": "Madrid, Spain"
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": {
                "type": "Point",
                "coordinates": [-0.127758, 51.507351]
            },
            "properties": {
                "address": "London, United Kingdom"
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": {
                "type": "Point",
                "coordinates": [-77.036871, 38.907192]
            },
            "properties": {
                "address": "Washington, DC"
            }
        }
    ]
};
```
> If your dataset is much bigger, you would probably store that content in an external file (see this [External GeoJSON layer](/developers/carto-vl/examples/#example-external-geojson-layer) example).

And then use it within a GeoJSON source, like this:
```js
const officesSource = new carto.source.GeoJSON(offices);
```

Create a custom style for the layer:
```js
const officesViz = new carto.Viz(`
    color: red
    width: 20
`);
```

Define a map layer:
```js
const officesLayer = new carto.Layer('offices', officesSource, officesViz);
```

And finally add that layer to the map:
```js
officesLayer.addTo(map);
```

Now the map should look like this:
<div class="example-map">
    <iframe
        id="guides-sources-source-geojson"
        src="/developers/carto-vl/examples/maps/guides/sources/step-2.html"
        width="100%"
        height="500"
        frameBorder="0">
    </iframe>
</div>

#### When to use a GeoJSON?
You already have your data in that format, and you currently don't have access to a CARTO account (if you have, you should import it to get a better performance and more capabilities, and then use another type of `Source`). It can also be a useful format for some quick tests, using inline GeoJSON if you are managing just a few rows or a *.geojson* file just next to your *.html*.


### SQL
SQL is a very common language to make queries in databases and geospatial software. It provides a flexible mechanism to adapt your dataset to your specific needs. Let's use it now in your map!

Define query, to select just the biggest cities in the world
```js
const query = 'SELECT * FROM populated_places WHERE megacity = 1';
```
> This is a very simple query but the SQL runs on CARTO's backend, which is powered by PostGIS, so you could also execute more sophisticated queries and even spatial analysis.

Create a SQL source:
```js
const megacitiesSource = new carto.source.SQL(query, {
    user: 'cartovl',
    apiKey: 'default_public'
});
```

Define the new style:
```js
const megacitiesViz = new carto.Viz('color: blue');
```

Create a common layer with those selected megacities:
```js
const megacitiesLayer = new carto.Layer('megacities', megacitiesSource, megacitiesViz);
```

And finally add this layer to the map:
```js
megacitiesLayer.addTo(map);
```

#### When to use SQL?
You have a CARTO account, with several custom datasets, and you want to visualize them in a layer, applying some kind of transformation to the source, from a simple filter to more advanced analysis.
